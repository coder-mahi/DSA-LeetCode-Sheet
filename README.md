## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/coder-mahi/DSA-LeetCode-Sheet.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to each data structure topic**:
   - Each `.md` file has a list of LeetCode problems categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).
   - Each problem is linked to its corresponding LeetCode problem page for easy access.

3. **Start solving problems**:
   - For each topic, practice problems to improve your understanding of that data structure.
   - Attempt problems based on your level (Easy, Medium, Hard).
   - For hard problems, attempt them after practicing the easier ones to ensure you're building your skills progressively.
